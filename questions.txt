1. Why is bubble sort slower than selection sort and insertion sort?
Please explain your answer (succinctly).
- bublle sort just rearrgages the number so many times until it fits into the spots where they are supposed to fit 


2. Why do two sort methods with the same Big-O still differ in performance?
- They can differ in performance because they can still have different number of swaps and moves to use. Causing one to be faster than the other 


3. What property does a custom class need to have for it to be usable in a list with the three sort methods you implemented? Give a name to the concept and also explain specifically in Python what would need to be implemented. Depending on your background with Python this may require some research.
- 

4. Why is Python's built-in sort so much faster than any of our implementations in this assignment? Is it primarily because it is better optimized, or is it something more fundamental?
- I think this is just a python thing. It updates itself to do things the correct and the fastest no matter how they do it.  So the sort they use is better than the ones I used in my code make it more obsolete
